            All modern websites and web applications are built using three
            <em>fundamental</em>
            technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of
            the web.

            In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
            about, and why you too should learn it.

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>

          <!-- <p>
            HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
            <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
            language that web developers use to structure and describe the
            content of a webpage (not a programming language).
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
            paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
            understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
          </p>

          <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
          </ol>
          <p>

            We are determined to delivering compassionate, respectful, and
            excellent care to those we serve. We want our patients to feel
            tender loving care. Our health care providers listen intensely as
            their patients discuss their health issues and symptoms. We believe
            that when the patient-doctor relationship is strong your health
            improves. We follow up with our patients to ensure that the best
            measures have been taken to heal their symptoms.
